# batocera-switch

This version of the code requires a file system for userdata that supports symlinking (EXT4, BTRFS) and is for x86_64 only!!  

This version integrates work from ordovice, foclabroc, Batocera Nation, and uureel.  It does not include the bios keys.  

## EASY INSTALL
From a terminal window, run the following:<br>
```curl -L bit.ly/foclabroc-switchoff-40 | bash```  (v39-v40)
```curl -L bit.ly/foclabroc-switchoff | bash```  (v41+)

After installing, place your prod.keys and title.keys in /share/bios/switch/  
If you wish to use Ryujinx you will also need to supply the firmware zip file

## SPECIAL THANKS
Special thanks for foclabroc, Rion, and Darknior and multiple members of the [Batocera Nation Discord](https://discord.gg/cuw5Xt7M7d) for testing things especially with the migration to SDL, [RGS] for a controller donation, and anyone else who contributes and helps me make this better.
